# codersATwar

This app is aiming to help or assist code mentors to be able to track the progress
of their students who are currently taking online courses on https://www.codewars.com.
With this app, mentors are able to add / register the targeted students using their fullnames
and the student's codewars username. They are also able to search a student using their
username. Upon a successful search, a mentor is then able to see what the student
has been up-to, how far are they with their katas as to what they still have to complete.
